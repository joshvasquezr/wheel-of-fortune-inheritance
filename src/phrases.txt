Change the world from here
Be the change you wish to see
Turn your wounds into wisdom
To infinity and beyond
With great power comes great responsibility
Frankly my dear I don’t give a damn
The stuff that dreams are made of
In the end we only regret the chances we didn’t take
The truth is out there
All men must die
I’ll be back
A day without laughter is a day wasted
There’s no place like home
